what about add small convention for the comment in the commit

the purpose is to inform with 1 or 2 digit the criticality of the commit

for example we can add 1 digit before the comment

* -: code clean => low risk, low modification
* ~: bug fix => medium risk, medium complexity
* +: add 1 function  => very granular
* *: add several functions => several piece of code
